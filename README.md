# Aillio Engineering Recruitment Test

Thanks for taking the time to do our front-end / full-stack programming test. This challenge has two parts:


1) A [task](#task) to create a basic authentication form.

2) Some [follow-up questions](./FOLLOW-UP.md).

----

You will be evaluated based on the following have been met:

* Your implementation works as described in the [task](#task).

* Your follow-up answers.

----

Please ask any question you may have on your dedicated slack channel!

## Prepackaged Tools

This project has been bootstrapped with a few of the tools we use here at Aillio including:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) + [SFC <script setup>](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html)

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have NVM installed to manage your current version of Node and NPM:

Now install all of the project's dependencies via Yarn:

```
yarn
```

To get started with local development, compile the frontend and boot up the backend using:

```
yarn serve
```

## Testing

The [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) testing framework is used to test all backend & frontend code.

To run the backend and frontend test suite once:

```
yarn test
```

## Task

We have placed a number of helpful todos inside the code (do a search for `@TODO`) to help get you started, the main items we are looking for are:

- Implement the remaining sign in logic within the backend server.
  - You may and should re-use existing code here.

- "Design" and implement the missing sign in page on the frontend.
  - See the session module for guidance.

## Submission Guidelines

Please clone this repository and zip up your work to send to us.

* The zip file should be named {yourname}.zip, and should itself contain this repo with your additions.

* The zip file should contain the [FOLLOW-UP.md](./FOLLOW-UP.md) file with answers to the follow-up questions.
